This is the atsread function for PD (pure-data) by Miller Puckette
It reads data and outputs data from atsfiles based on a time pointer.  See the help-atsread.pd file for more info about how to use it.
The external does not depend on any other externals but the help-file uses the Zexy external to synthesize the sine waves.

I have only tested it for Linux and haven't had any problems with the current software, please e-mail me if you find problems.

Here is how I compile it (with "m_pd.h" from the PD source in the same directory)
gcc -shared -o atsread.pd_linux atsread.c

or to allow byte swapping:
gcc -DBYTESWAP -shared -o atsread.pd_linux atsread.c

Then p ut the atsread.pd_linux file into your path somewhere (most likely your "externals" directory) and put the help-*.pd, cl.ats and crt.ats in your help directory (which should also be in your pd path hopefully).

This software is free for non-commercial use, use it at your own risk, I assume no responsibility, though if you do find a problem I'll try to fix it.
