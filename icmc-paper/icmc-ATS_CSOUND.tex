\textit{\hspace*{-0.1in}ATS is a spectral modeling system based on
a sinusoidal plus critical-band noise decomposition. The original
system interface was through LISP and CLM, but significant improvements
have been made by porting the concepts of ATS to the C language. This
work has also been extended to create interfaces for two popular synthesis
languages: Csound and Pd. This paper presents several ways of working
with ATS data using tools written by the authors.}


\section{ATS Overview}

ATS is a spectral modeling system developed by Juan Pampin for representing
sound as a combination of sinusoidal trajectories and bandlimited
noise. The analysis engine uses Perceptual Audio Coding (PAC) techniques
such as Signal to Mask Ratio (SMR) evaluation along with traditional
signal processing techniques to achieve perceptually accurate sinusoidal
tracking. The systems noise component is modeled using Bark scale
frequency warping to evaluate sub-band noise energy, which is distributed
among the partials belonging to each critical band. The analysis model
consists of temporal frames, each of which contains a set of partials
having amplitude and frequency values, with optional phase information.
Each frame may also contain the psychoacoustic noise information obtained
from analyzing the residual (the residual is what's left after subtracting
the tracked sinusoidal trajectories from the original sound). Please
visit http://atsa.sourceforge.net for detailed information on the
sinusoids plus critical-band noise model.


\section{Csound Interface}

Several csound unit generators exist to extract data from ATS files.
Many of these ugens are derived from, and work much like Richard Karpen's
phase vocoder unit generators for csound (pvread, pvadd etc.). As
with pvread, most of the ATS-related ugens take a \char`\"{}time pointer\char`\"{}
that is used to index data from ATS data files. Linear interpolation
is used to approximate data between analysis frames.

The csound unit generators can be broken down into two groups: those
that act independently, and those that depend on the unit generator
atsbufread.


\subsection{Independent Unit Generators}

All of the independent ugens take an ATS file and a time pointer as
arguments. Using these and other arguments, the ugens extract data
from an ATS file at the time indicated by the time pointer.

\textbf{atsread} and \textbf{atsreadnz} are the most generic ugens
in the ats-csound package. Each of these ugens simply read data (with
interpolation) out of an ATS data file and return it for arbitrary
use. atsread returns the frequency and amplitude information of a
user specified partial. atsreadnz takes a noise band number and returns
the corresponding noise energy data.

\textbf{atsadd} and \textbf{atsaddnz} use data from ATS analysis files
to synthesize sine-waves or noise respectively. atsadd uses a standard
interpolated table look-up synthesis method to synthesize an array
of sinusoids. These are combined additively to produce a single audio
rate output. The user specifies a range of partials to synthesize.
The frequency and amplitude information for these partials are taken
from a given ATS data file. A frequency multiplier, given by the user,
is used before synthesis to transpose the data in frequency.

Like pvadd, atsadd provides an optional amplitude \char`\"{}gate\char`\"{}
function. This \char`\"{}gate\char`\"{} function is given by a csound
f-table and is used to scale the partials' amplitudes. Amplitudes
are normalized based on the maxim amplitude in the analysis file.
The gate function uses these normalized amplitudes to index the provided
f-table. A partial with an amplitude of 0 will index the first data
point in the f-table. A partial with the maximum amplitude in the
analysis file will index the last position in the f-table. The value
of the indexed data is used to scale the amplitudes before synthesis.
With this \char`\"{}gate\char`\"{} function a user can distort the
re-synthesis in subtle or extreme ways.

atsaddnz synthesizes a set of noise bands indicated by the user. It
does this using an array of band limited noise bands that are modulated
by sine waves to be put into the correct place in the frequency spectrum.
These bands are combined additively to produce a single audio rate
output. The range of bands in the synthesis is determined by the user.

\textbf{atssinnoi} synthesizes sine waves and noise together in a
unique manner. Partials are synthesized using an internal oscillator.
A noise band is synthesized for each partial. The energy for each
noise band derived from the energy in the analysis noise bands. Each
partial falls into a specific noise band. The noise energy for each
band is distributed equally among the partials in that band. This
is the energy used to synthesize the noise band for each partial.
The bandwidth of a partial's noise band is determined by a function
of the partial's frequency. Once the noise bands have been synthesized
they are modulated by their corresponding partial. Finally, after
being scaled appropriately, all of the sine-waves and noise bands
are added together to give a single audio rate output.

As with atsadd a frequency multiplier can be used to transpose the
data in frequency. Using provided k-rate inputs, a user can scale
the total amplitude of the sine-waves and noise independently after
the noise modulation occurs.

The final independent unit generator \textbf{atsbufread} has no outputs
that are directly accessible by the user. atsbufread takes data from
an ATS file and produces a table of partials' amplitude and frequency
values in memory. This memory can be accessed by other unit generators.
Like atsadd, atsbufread uses a time pointer and a users specified
list of partials to produce the table. The next section will describe
the unit generators that operate on data provided by atsbufread.


\subsection{atsbufread Dependent Unit Generators}

\textbf{atsinterpread} takes a single argument, a frequency value.
Using this frequency value atsinterpread indexes a table produced
by an atsbufread u-gen and returns the corresponding amplitude value.
Interpolation is used for in-between values. This u-gen can be useful
for cross synthesizing non ATS derived signals with data from ATS.

\textbf{atspartialtap} works almost exactly like atsread except it
reads data from a table produced by an atsbufread. The only argument
this u-gen takes is a partial number; it returns frequency and amplitude
data. This u-gen is useful if a user wants to operate on multiple
partials separately using the same time pointer. While this can easily
be achieved with an array of atsreads all using the same time pointer,
its simplicity makes it attractive.

\textbf{atscross}, based on pvcross, allows a user to perform cross
synthesis using the data from two ATS files. One of these ATS files
comes from the atsbufread, the other is provided by the atscross unit
generator. Data is extracted from the ATS file indicated by the atscross
u-gen, and used to index the table produced by the atsbufread u-gen
in the same way as atsinterpread indexes the table. Now each partial
from the ATS file provided by the atscross u-gen has two amplitudes;
the original amplitude from its data file and the amplitude interpolated
from the ATS file of the corresponding atsbufread u-gen. Each of these
amplitudes is then scaled independently by user specified k-rate values.
The amplitudes are then summed and used, with the frequency of the
corresponding partial for synthesis. Synthesis is then achieved using
an internal oscillator. The independent amplitude scalars can be varied
to achieve morphing from a standard atsadd sound to a cross-synthesized
sound.


\section{Pd Interface}

In order to access ATS data in real time we have created an object
for Pure-Data. This object allows users to access data in a similar
way to the Csound unit generators \textbf{atsread} and \textbf{atsreadnz}.
This pd object is called \textbf{atsread}.

\textbf{atsread} uses a time pointer the same way that its Csound
counterpart does. The pd version combines the functionality of the
csound atsread and atsread noise. In addition to it's combined functionality
the pd object can output lists of data, allowing for one object to
output all the partial and noise data for one file. atsread for pd
has three outputs: the first output gives a list of frequency values,
the second gives a list of corresponding amplitude values, and the
third gives a list of noise energy values. These lists are always
given in order from lowest partial/band to highest partial/band. The
user opens an ATS file for access by sending a message in this format:
\char`\"{}open cl.ats\char`\"{}, alternatively the ATS file name can
be given as an argument to the object. A user can set a range of partials
by giving messages of the form \char`\"{}set 1 2 5 10..20\char`\"{}.
This example would output partials 1, 2, 5, and 10-20 (if they exist
in the data file). Partials can be added to be output using messages
of the form \char`\"{}add 3 4..7 9\char`\"{}. This would add partials
3, 4-7 and 9 to be output, and continue outputting the partials that
were being output before. Finally partials can be removed from the
output by using messages of the form \char`\"{}remove 4..6 11 13\char`\"{}.
The same operations can be performed on noise bands by appending an
\char`\"{}nz\char`\"{} to the first argument of the message, IE. \char`\"{}setnz
1 2 17\char`\"{}.

The pd atsread object can also be made to only output noise or sine-waves
using the \char`\"{}nosines\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}nonoise\char`\"{},
\char`\"{}sines\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}noise\char`\"{}\char`\"{}
messages. \char`\"{}nosines\char`\"{} turns off frequency and amplitude
outputs, \char`\"{}sines\char`\"{} turns them back on. Similarly \char`\"{}nonoise\char`\"{}
turns off noise outputs; \char`\"{}noise\char`\"{} turns them back
on. These messages can also be given as arguments to the object.

As with the csound atsread function the user is left to do what she/he
wants with the data. Synthesis can be preformed with a bank of oscillators,
though the data could also be used as control data for other operations.


\section{ATSH}

ATSH is a graphical editor for ATS files. Besides being capable of
displaying ATS information in several different ways, ATSH can also
be used for the analysis, transformation, and synthesis of any sound.


\subsection{Analysis}

Analysis parameters must be carefully tuned for the analysis algorithm
to properly capture the nature of the signal to be analyzed. As there
are a significant number of parameters, ATSH offers the possibility
of saving and loading them via a binary analysis parameters file ({*}.apf
file). A brief explanation of each analysis parameter follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start (secs.): the starting time of the analysis in seconds. 
\item Duration (secs.): the duration of the analysis in seconds. A zero
means the whole duration of the input sound file. 
\item Lowest Frequency (Hz.): this parameter will partially determine the
size of the analysis window to be used. To compute the size of the
analysis window, the period of the Lowest Frequency in samples (SR
/ LF) is multiplied by the number of cycles of it the user wants to
fit in the analysis window (see parameter 6). This value is rounded
to the next power of two to determine the size of the FFT for the
analysis. The remaining samples are zero-padded. If the signal is
a single, harmonic sound, then the value of the Lowest Frequency should
be its fundamental frequency or a sub-harmonic of it. If it is not
harmonic, then its lowest significant frequency component may be a
good starting value. 
\item Highest Frequency (Hz.): highest frequency to be taken into account
for Peak Detection. Once it is determined that no relevant information
is found beyond a certain frequency, the analysis may be faster and
more accurate setting the Highest Frequency parameter to that value. 
\item Frequency Deviation (Ratio): frequency deviation allowed for each
peak in the Peak Tracking Algorithm, as a ratio of the frequency involved.
For instance, a peak at 440 Hz and a Deviation of .1 means that the
Peak Tracking Algorithm will only try to find candidates for its continuation
between 396 and 484 Hz (10\% above and below the frequency of the
peak). A small value is likely to produce more trajectories whilst
a large value will reduce them, but at the cost of rendering information
difficult to be further processed. 
\item Number of Cycles of Lowest Frequency to fit in Analysis Window: this
will also partially determine the size of the Fourier Analysis Window
to be used. See Parameter 3. For single harmonic signals, it is supposed
to be more than one (typically 4). 
\item Hop Size (Ratio): size of the gap between one Analysis Window and
the next expressed as a ratio of the Window Size. For instance, a
Hop Size value of .25 will produce an Analysis Window of 2048 samples
to \char`\"{}jump\char`\"{} by 512 samples (Windows will overlap
by 75\% of their size). This parameter will also determine the size
of the analysis frames obtained. Signals that change their spectra
very fast (such as Speech sounds) may need a high frame rate in order
to properly track their changes.
\item Amplitude Threshold (dB): the highest amplitude value to be taken
into account for Peak Detection. 
\item Window Type: the shape of the smoothing function to be used for the
Fourier Analysis. There are four choices available at present: Blackman,
Blackman-Harris, Von Hann, and Hanning. Precise specifications about
these functions are easily found in any D.S.P. textbook.
\item Track Length (Frames): the number of frames to look back. The Peak
Tracking Algorithm will look back a number of frames in order to prevent
frequency trajectories from curving too much and loosing stability.
However, a large value for this parameter will slow down the analysis
significantly. 
\item Minimal Segment Length (Frames): once the analysis is done, the spectral
data can be optimized during post-processing. Trajectories shorter
than this value are suppressed if their average SMR is below Minimal
Segment SMR (see parameters 16 and 14). This might help to avoid non-relevant
sudden changes while keeping a high frame rate, reducing also the
number of intermittent sinusoids during synthesis. 
\item Minimal Gap Length (Frames): as parameter 11, this one is also used
to optimize the data during post-processing. In this case, gaps (zero
amplitude values, i.e. theoretical silence) longer than this number
of frames are filled up with amplitude and frequency values obtained
by linear interpolation of the adjacent active frames. This parameter
prevents sudden interruptions of stable trajectories while keeping
a high frame rate. 
\item SMR Threshold (dB SPL): also a post-processing parameter, the SMR
Threshold is used to eliminate partials with low averages. 
\item Minimal Segment SMR (dB SPL): this parameter is used in combination
with parameter 11. Short segments with SMR average below this value
will be removed during post-processing. 
\item Last Peak Contribution (0 to 1): as explained in Parameter 10, the
Peak Tracking Algorithm looks back several number of frames to do
its job better. This parameter will help to weight the contribution
of the first precedent peak over the others. A zero value means that
all precedent peaks (to the size of Parameter 10) are equally taken
in account. 
\item SMR Contribution (0 to 1): In addition to the proximity in frequency
of the peaks, the ATS Peak Continuation Algorithm may use psychoacoustic
information (the Signal-to-Mask-Ratio, or SMR) to improve the perceptual
results. This parameter indicates how much the SMR information is
used during tracking. For instance, a value of .5 tells the Peak Tracking
Algorithm to use 50\% of the SMR information and 50\% of the Frequency
Proximity information to decide which is the best candidate to continue
a sinusoidal track. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Transformation}


\subsubsection{Viewing Data}

Three types of ATS data can be viewed in ATSH:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sinusoidal: The frequency of each partial is represented on the vertical
(Y) axis, Time (in frames) runs along the horizontal (X) axis, and
amplitude is represented with a color value. The two horizontal scrollbars
control the time (frame) view. The top one controls the start frame
value, and the bottom one controls the number of frames to view. There
are three vertical scrollbars as well. The two left-most ones control
the frequency view (in a similar way the horizontal scrollbars control
the time view). The right-most scrollbar controls a contrast value
for the amplitude display: a value of 50 shows the normal contrast
between loud and quiet partials, while a value of 100 overrides amplitude
information (i.e. all partials are displayed black). A value of 0
shows only very loud partials. If the mouse pointer is on the image,
the frame number, time, and frequency values of its position are printed
on the status bar on the bottom of the window. 
\item Noise: in order to view this, the analysis file must contain noise
data. The energy value of each of the 25 Critical Bands (in the Bark
scale) is shown as a color value along frames. If the mouse pointer
is on the image, the frame number, time, frequency and energy values
of its position are printed on the status bar. 
\item Header: The user can display the file header data by choosing view->file
header. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Selecting Data}

To make any changes, the user must select some data. ATSH performs
both a horizontal (frame) and a vertical (partial) selection. There
are four ways to select spectral data:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using selection presets from the Edit menu. There are Select All,
Unselect All, Select Even, Select Odd, and Invert Selection routines. 
\item Using the mouse. Block selection: When the left button is pressed,
the position of the mouse pointer at the first click represents the
first corner of a rectangular selection, and the position of the mouse
at the second click the diagonally-opposed corner of it. Single selection:
When the right button is pressed, the partial having the closer frequency
to the location of the pointer is selected or deselected. If a block
selection was previously done, and the pointer of the mouse is in
the selection rectangle, the other selected partials remains selected.
Otherwise, the selection is replaced by the new selected partial for
all the extent of the view. The data selected is displayed in red. 
\item Using the List View window (in the View menu). All the data can be
seen in the form of a numerical list. The amplitude, frequency and
phase (if any) values of each frame are represented in each column
of the list. A vertical selection/deselection can be performed shift-clicking
/ ctrl-clicking on the list (note that the user may also perform a
non-contiguous selection of partials as well). The horizontal selection
may be done using the NOW=TO and NOW=FROM buttons. 
\item Using the smart selection menu item. This menu allows the user to
select partials in the current view using both amplitude evaluation
and/or a fix step of partial order. As an example: setting from 1
to 10, jump by 2 and Amp. Threshold of -36 will select partials 1,
3, 5, 7 and 9 only if their amplitude (Peak or RMS) is above -36dB. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Editing Data}

At present, the only ways to change the selected data are to vary
the amplitude or the frequency. This is accomplished by applying an
envelope (linear or spline) to the amplitude or frequency values of
the partials in the selected region. The envelopes can either scale
the data by multiplying the envelope values, or offset the data by
adding the envelope values.

If the resulting frequency values are greater than the maximum frequency
value present in the file, they will be truncated to this value. Also,
if the frequency values are changed, the phase information (if any)
is suppressed.

There are an unlimited number of {}``undos'' available to the user
as well as the possibility for editing multiple files by running several
instances of ATSH.


\subsection{Synthesis}

In order to synthesize data, an output sound file name must be entered.
The sound file format will be determined from the file extension.
The user may choose to synthesize the sinusoidal part, the noise part(if
any), or a mix of both by manipulating the amplitudes.

Several features concerning synthesis may be set on the Synthesis->Parameters
menu item. The user may scale the overall amplitude and frequency
of the original data using scalars. Note also that synthesis may use
all the data, or just a selection (if any). At present, the ATSH sinusoidal
synthesis engine is implemented as an array of linear interpolating
table-lookup oscillators. The noise part is synthesized by injecting
interpolated-noise modulation to each partial according to the energy
of the residual found in each critical band at the corresponding analysis
frame.

It is possible also to use a time function which allows the user to
stretch the file dynamically as well as read it forward or backwards.
The duration of the output file is represented on the X (horizontal)
axis while the temporal location of the data of the analysis to be
used in the synthesis is represented on the Y (vertical) axis.
