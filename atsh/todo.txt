Synthesis:

1-Add DC Blocker to the residual
2-Substractive Synthesis
3-Rethink Time envelope (possibly have a time transformation function)
4-Amplitude of residual bands with curves. (we will do it "on the fly" in the Synthesis, can't do it now because I do no have sound output to test the results)


Edition:

2-Track deleting
3-Region deleting
4-Add dismiss button to list view.
5-SMR/Amplitude display.
6-Smart selection using frequency with harmonic factor and SMR threshold.

Analysis: make info printed to stdout into a form with progress bar

- label the zoom bars and contrast bar or separate the two zoom bars out of the contrast one. Take out the number on the latter.
- move the frame and frequency info from bottom right corner to bottom centered, or maybe to status bar (if one exists)

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
idea for menu layout:
the menu should be layed out as below, with the same order as below

Analysis (was File)
 -Load ATS file
 -Save ATS file
 -New ATS file
 -Quit
 (remove 'set output soundfile')

Transformation (was Edit)
(keep everything as is for now)

Synthesis
 -Parameters (keep same)
 -Synthesize (was Resynthesize)
 -Playback controls (when implemented)

View
 Replace Sinusoidal and Noise by
a call to a Configuration View Window

Help
 -Documentation (launch the html documentation)
 -About (keep same)


ATSA:
OK!

GENERAL:
1-Optimize MAKEFILE --- some done, do we need more?
