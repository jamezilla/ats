<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>atsadd</strong> and <strong>atsaddnz</strong> are based on pvadd by
Richard Karpen and use files created by Juan Pampin's <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/%7Ejuan/ATS.html">ATS (Analysis -
Transformation - Synthesis)</a>.  <strong>atssinnoi</strong> is based on ATS's
sinnoi synth.  <strong>atsadd</strong> reads from an <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/%7Ejuan/ATS.html"><strong>ATS</strong></a>
analysis file and uses the data to perform additive synthesis using an internal
array of interpolating oscillators.  The user supplies the wave table (usually
one period of a sine wave), and can choose which analysis partials will be used
in the re-synthesis. <strong>atsaddnz</strong> also reads from an <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/%7Ejuan/ATS.html"><strong>ATS</strong></a>
file but it resynthesizes the noise from noise energy data contained in the ATS
file.  It uses a modified randi function to create band limited noise and
modulates that with a user supplied wave table (one period of a cosine wave),
to synthesize a user specified selection of frequency bands. Modulating the
noise is required to put the band limited noise in the correct place in the
frequency spectrum.  <strong>atssinnoi</strong> reads data from an ATS data
file and uses the information to synthesize sines and noise together.  The
noise energy for each band is distributed equally among each partial that falls
in that band.  Each partial is then synthesized, along with that partial's
noise component.  Each noise component is then modulated by the corresponding
partial to be put in the correct place in the frequency spectrum.  The level of
the noise and the partials are individually controllable.  See the <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/%7Ejuan/ATS.html">ATS webpage</a> for more
info about the sinnoi synthesis.  An <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/%7Ejuan/ATS.html"><strong>ATS</strong></a>
analysis differs from a pvanal in that ATS tracks the partials and computes the
noise energy of the sound being analyzed.  For more info about ATS analysis
read Juan Pampin's description on the <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/%7Ejuan/ATS.html#analysis">the ATS
web-page.</a></p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p><em>ktimepnt</em> &#8211; a time pointer for reading through the ats
file</p>

<p><em>kfmod</em> &#8211; an input for performing pitch transposition or
frequency modulation on all of the synthesized partials, if no fm or pitch
change is desired then use a 1 for this value</p>

<p><em>iatsfile</em> &#8211; integer or character-string denoting a
control-file derived from ATS analysis of an audio signal. An integer denotes
the suffix of a file <em>ats.m</em>; a character-string (in double quotes)
gives a filename, optionally a full pathname. If not full-path, the file is
sought first in the current directory, then in the one given by the environment
variable <strong>SADIR</strong> (if defined).  </p>

<p><em>ifn</em> &#8211; table number of a stored function containing a sine
wave for atsadd and a cosine for atsaddnz (see examples below for more
info)</p>

<p><em>ipartials / ibands</em> &#8211; number of partials or noise bands that
will be used in the resynthesis (the noise has a maximum of 25 bands)</p>

<p><em>ipartialoffset / ibandoffset</em> (optional) &#8211; is the first
partial or noise band used (defaults to 0).  </p>

<p><em>ipartialincr / ibandincr</em> (optional) &#8211; sets an increment by
which these synthesis opcodes counts up from
<em>ipartialoffset/ibandoffset</em> for <em>ibins</em> components in the
re-synthesis (defaults to 1).  </p>

<p><em>ksinlev</em> controls the level of the sines in the
<strong>atssinnoi</strong> ugen. A value of 1 gives full volume sinewaves.</p>

<p><em>knzlev</em> controls the level of the noise components in the
<strong>atssinnoi</strong> ugen. A value of 1 gives full volume noise.</p>

<p><em>igatefn</em> (optional) &#8211; is the number of a stored function which
will be applied to the amplitudes of the analysis bins before resynthesis takes
place. If <em>igatefn</em> is greater than 0 the amplitudes of each bin will be
scaled by <em>igatefn</em> through a simple mapping process. First, the
amplitudes of all of the bins in all of the frames in the entire analysis file
are compared to determine the maximum amplitude value. This value is then used
create normalized amplitudes as indices into the stored function
<em>igatefn</em>.  The maximum amplitude will map to the last point in the
function. An amplitude of 0 will map to the first point in the function. Values
between 0 and 1 will map accordingly to points along the function table. This
will be made clearer in the examples below. </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p><em>ktimpnt</em> and <em>kfmod</em> are used in the same way as in
<strong>pvoc</strong>.  </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
1.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong>  0, p3, 2.5
  asig  <strong>atsadd</strong> ktime, 1, "clarinet.ats", 1, 20, 2</pre>
<p>In the example above, <em>ipartials</em> is 20 and <em>ipartialoffset</em>
is 2.  This will synthesize the 3rd thru 22nd partials in the "clarinet.ats"
analysis file.  kmod is 1 so there will be no pitch transformation.  Since the
<em>ktimepnt</em> envelope moves from 0 to 2.5 over the duration of the note,
the analysis file will be read from 0 to 2.5 seconds of the original duration
of the analysis over the duration of the csound note, this way we can change
the duration independent of the pitch.

</p>

2.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong>  0, p3, 2.5
  asig  <strong>atsaddnz</strong> ktime, "clarinet.ats", 2, 25</pre>
<p>In the example above we're synthesizing all 25 noise bands from the data
contained in the ATS analysis file called "clarinet.ats", we're using function
table 2, which should be a cosine ie:</p> 

<pre>  f2 0 4096 9 1 1 90</pre>

3.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong>  0, p3, 2.5
  asig  <strong>atsadd</strong> ktime, 1.0125, "clarinet.ats", 1, 20, 0, 2</pre>
<p>In the above example we synthesize 20 partials as in example 1 except this
time we're using a <em>ipartialoffset</em> of 0 and <em>ipartialincr</em> of 2,
which means that we'll start from the first partial and synthesize 20 partials
total, skipping every other one (ie. partial 1, 3, 5,...).  We've also
increased the pitch of the result (<em>kfmod</em> is set to 1.0125).</p> 

4.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong>  2.5, p3, 0
  asig <strong>atsaddnz</strong> ktime, 1, "clarinet.ats", 2, 1, 24</pre>

<p> Here we synthesize only the 25th noise band (<em>ibandoffset</em> of 24 and
<em>ibands</em> of 1).  Also our time pointer is going from 2.5 to 0 over the
duration of the note so we're reading backwards from 2.5 seconds in the
analysis file.  </p>

5.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong>  0, p3, 2.5
  asig <strong>atssinnoi</strong> ktime, 1, 1, 1, "clarinet.ats", 42</pre>

<p>Here we synthesize both the noise and the sinewaves (all 42 partials)
contained in "clarinet.ats" together.  The relative volumes of the noise and
the partials are unaltered (each set to 1).</p>

6.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong>  0, p3, 2.5
  knzfade <strong>expon</strong>  0.001, p3, 2.5
  asig <strong>atssinnoi</strong> ktime, 1, knzfade, 1, "clarinet.ats", 42</pre>

<p>This example here is like example 5 except that we use an envelope
to control <em>knzlev</em> (the noise level).  The result of this will be a
clarinet sound that has its noise component fade in over the duration of the
note.</p>
