<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>atsread</strong> and <strong>atsreadnz</strong> read data from an <strong>ATS</strong> file.  atsread returns the amplitude (<em>kamp</em>) and frequency (<em>kfreq</em>) 
information of a user specified partial contained in the ATS
analysis file at the time indicated by the time pointer <em>ktimepnt</em>.  atsreadnz returns the energy (<em>kenergy</em>) of a user specified noise band (1-25 bands) at the time indicated by the time
pointer <em>ktimepnt</em>.
</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p><em>ifile</em> &#8211; the <strong>ATS</strong> number (n in ats.n) or the name in quotes of the analysis file made using ATS.</p>
<p><em>ipartial / iband</em> &#8211; the number of the analysis partial to return the frequency in Hz and amplitude (in the case of atsread) 
or the number of the noise band to return the energy data (in the case of atsreadnz).
</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p><em>kfreq</em>, <em>kamp</em> &#8211; outputs of the <strong>atsread</strong> unit.  These values represent the frequency and amplitude of a specific partial
selected by the user using <em>ipartial</em>.  The partials' informations are derived from an ATS analysis.  <strong>atsread</strong> linearly interpolates the 
frequency and amplitude between frames in the ATS analysis file; this happens at the k-rate.  The output is dependent on the data in the analysis file and the <em>ktimepnt</em>.
</p>
<p><em>kenergy</em> &#8211; output of the <strong>atsreadnz</strong> unit.  At the k-rate the linearly interpolated energy of the noise band indicated in <em>iband</em> is
output.  The output is dependent on the data in the analysis file and the <em>ktimepnt</em>.

</p>
<p><em>ktimepnt</em> &#8211; used for <strong>atsread</strong> and <strong>atsreadnz</strong> exactly the same as for <strong>pvoc</strong> and <strong>atsadd</strong>.

<h3>Examples</h3>
1.
<pre>  ktime	line  0, p3, 2.5
  kfreq, kamp	atsread	ktime, "clarinet.ats", 2
  aout	oscili	1000000 * kamp, kfreq, 1</pre>
<p>Here we're using atsread to get the 2nd partial's frequency and amplitude data out of the clarinet.ats ATS analysis file.  
We're using that data to drive an oscillator, but we could use it for anything else that can take a k-rate input, like the bandwidth and resonance of a filter etc.
</p>

2.
<pre>  ktime	line	2.5, p3, 0
  kenergy	atsreadnz ktime, "clarinet.ats", 5
  </pre>
<p>Here we are extracting the noise energy from band 5 in the clarinet.ats ATS analysis file.  We're actually reading backwards from 2.5 seconds to the beginning of the analysis file.  We could use this to synthesize noise like this:</p>

<pre>  anoise	randi	sqrt(kenergy), 55
  aout        oscili  4000000000000000000000000, 455, 2
  aout = aout * anoise</pre>
  <p>Function table 2 used in the oscillator is a cosine, which is needed to shift the band limited noise into the correct place in the frequency spectrum.  The randi function
  creates a band of noise centered about 0 Hz that has a bandwidth of about 110 Hz; multiplying it by a cosine will shift it to be centered at 455 Hz, which is the center frequency of the 5th critical noise band.
  This is only an example, for synthesizing the noise you'd be better off just using atsaddnz unless you want to use your own noise synthesis algorithm.
Maybe you could use the noise energy for something else like applying a small amount of jitter to specific partials or for controlling something totally unrelated
to the source sound?
