<h3>Description</h3>

<p>

  <strong>atsbufread</strong> is based on pvbufread by Richard Karpen.
  <strong>atscross</strong>, <strong>atsinterpread</strong> and
  <strong>atspartialtap</strong> are all dependent on
  <strong>atsbufread</strong> just as pvcross and pvinterp are on pvbufread.
  <strong>atsbufread</strong> reads data from and ATS data file and stores it in
  an internal data table of frequency, amplitude pairs.  The data stored by an
  <strong>atsbufread</strong> can only be accessed by other unit generators, and
  therefore, due to the architecture of Csound, an <strong>atsbufread</strong>
  must come before (but not necessarily directly) any dependent unit generator.
  Besides the fact that <strong>atsbufread</strong> doesn't output any data
  directly, it works almost exactly as <a
  href="atssynth.html"><strong>atsadd</strong></a>.  The ugen uses a time
  pointer (<em>ktimepnt</em>) to index the data in time, <em>ipartials</em>,
  <em>ipartialoffset</em> and <em>ipartialincr</em> to select which partials to
  store in the table and <em>kfmod</em> to scale partials in frequency.

</p>

<p>
  
  <strong>atscross</strong> uses data from an ATS analysis file (indicated by
  <em>iatsfile</em>) and data from an <strong>atsbufread</strong> to perform
  cross synthesis.  <strong>atscross</strong> uses <em>ktimepnt</em>,
  <em>kfmod</em>, <em>ipartials</em>, <em>ipartialoffset</em> and
  <em>ipartialincr</em> just like <a href="atssynth.html">
  <strong>atsadd</strong> </a>.  <strong>atscross</strong> synthesizes a
  sine-wave for each partial selected by the user and uses the frequency of that
  partial (after scaling in frequency by <em>kfmod</em>) to index the table
  created by <strong>atsbufread</strong>.  Interpolation is used to get
  in-between values.  <strong>atscross</strong> uses the sum of the amplitude
  data from its ATS file (scaled by <em>kmylev</em>) and the amplitude data
  gained from an <strong>atsbufread</strong> (scaled by <em>kbuflev</em>) to
  scale the amplitude of each partial it synthesizes.  Setting <em>kmylev</em>
  to one and <em>kbuflev</em> to zero will make <strong>atscross</strong> act
  exactly like <strong>atsadd</strong>.  Setting <em>kmylev</em> to zero and
  <em>kbuflev</em> to one will produce a sound that has all the partials
  selected by the <strong>atscross</strong> ugen, but with amplitudes taken from
  an <strong>atsbufread</strong>.  The time pointers of the
  <strong>atsbufread</strong> and <strong>atscross</strong> do not need to be
  the same.

</p>

<p>

  <strong>atsinterpread</strong> takes a frequency value (<em>kfreq</em> in Hz).
  This frequency is used to index the data of an <strong>atsbufread</strong>.
  The return value is an amplitude gained from the <strong>atsbufread</strong>
  after interpolation.  <strong>atsinterpread</strong> allows a user to
  determine the frequency envelope of any <strong>atsbufread</strong>.  This
  data could be useful for an number of reasons, one might be performing cross
  synthesis of data from an ATS file and non ATS data.

</p>

<p>

  <strong>atspartialtap</strong> takes a partial number and returns a frequency,
  amplitude pair.  The frequency and amplitude data comes from an
  <strong>atsbufread</strong> opcode.  This is more restricted version of <a
  href="atsread.html"><strong>atsread</strong></a>, since each
  <strong>atsread</strong> opcode has its own independent time pointer, and
  <strong>atspartialtap</strong> is restricted to the data given by an
  <strong>atsbufread</strong>.  Its simplicity is its attractive feature.

</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p><em>ktimepnt</em> &#8211; a time pointer for reading through the ATS
file</p>

<p><em>kfmod</em> &#8211; an input for performing pitch transposition or
frequency modulation on all of the synthesized partials, if no fm or pitch
change is desired then use a 1 for this value</p>

<p><em>iatsfile</em> &#8211; integer or character-string denoting a
control-file derived from ATS analysis of an audio signal. An integer denotes
the suffix of a file <em>ATS.m</em>; a character-string (in double quotes)
gives a filename, optionally a full pathname. If not full-path, the file is
sought first in the current directory, then in the one given by the environment
variable <strong>SADIR</strong> (if defined).  </p>

<p><em>ifn</em> &#8211; table number of a stored function containing a sine
wave for atsadd and a cosine for atsaddnz (see examples below for more
info)</p>

<p><em>ipartials / ibands</em> &#8211; number of partials or noise bands that
will be used in the re-synthesis (the noise has a maximum of 25 bands)</p>

<p><em>ipartialoffset / ibandoffset</em> (optional) &#8211; is the first
partial or noise band used (defaults to 0).  </p>

<p><em>ipartialincr / ibandincr</em> (optional) &#8211; sets an increment by
which these synthesis opcodes counts up from
<em>ipartialoffset/ibandoffset</em> for <em>ibins</em> components in the
re-synthesis (defaults to 1).  </p>

<p><em>kmylev</em> scales the atscross component of the frequency spectrum
applied to the partials from the ATS file indicated by the
<strong>atscross</strong> opcode.  The frequency spectrum information comes
from the <strong>atscross</strong> ATS file.  A value of 1 (and 0 for kbuflev) gives the same results as
atsadd.</p>

<p><em>kbuflev</em> scales the atsbufread component of the frequency spectrum
applied to the partials from the ATS file indicated by the
<strong>atscross</strong> opcode.  The frequency spectrum information comes
from the <strong>atsbufread</strong> ATS file.  A value of 1 (and 0 for kmylev)
results in partials that have frequency information from the ATS file given by
the <strong>atscross</strong>, but amplitudes imposed by data from the ATS file
given by <strong>atsbufread</strong></p>

<p><em>kfreq</em> is a frequency value (given in Hertz) used by
<strong>atsinterpread</strong> as in index into the table produced by an
<strong>atsbufread</strong> </p>

<p><em>ipartialnum</em> indicates the partial that the
<strong>atspartialtap</strong> opcode should read from an
<strong>atsbufread</strong>.  </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p><em>ktimpnt</em> and <em>kfmod</em> are used in the same way as in
<strong>pvoc</strong>.  </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
1.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong> 0, p3, 2.4
  ktime2 <strong>line</strong> 0, p3, .5
  kline <strong>expseg</strong> 0.001, .9, 1, p3-.9, 1
  kline2 <strong>expseg</strong> .001, p3, 1
  <strong>atsbufread</strong>  ktime2, 1, "crt.ats", 20
  aout <strong>atscross</strong> ktime, 1, "cl.ats", 1, kline, .001* (1 - kline2), 42</pre>
<p>
	This example performs cross synthesis using two ATS files, crt.ats and
	cl.ats.  The result of this will be a sound that starts out with the shape
	(in frequency) of crt.ats, and ends with the shape of cl.ats.  All the
	sine-wave frequencies come from cl.ats.  The <em>kbuflev</em> value is scaled
	because the energy produced by applying crt.ats's frequency spectrum to
	cl.ats's partials is very large.  Notice also that the time pointers of the
	atsbufread (crt.ats) and atscross (cl.ats) need not have the same value, this
	way you can read through the two ATS files at different rates.
</p>

2.
<pre>  ktime  <strong>line</strong>  0, p3, 2.4
  <strong>atsbufread</strong>  ktime, 1, "cl.ats", 42
  kamp  <strong>atsinterpread</strong> p4
  aosc  <strong>oscili</strong>  kamp, p4, 1
  </pre>
<p>
	This example shows how to use atsinterpread.  Here a frequency is given by
	the score (p4) and this frequency is given to an atsinterpread (with a
	corresponding atsbufread).  The atsinterpread uses this frequency to output a
	corresponding amplitude value, based on the atsfile given by the atsbufread
	(cl.ats in this case).  We then use that amplitude to scale a sine-wave that
	is synthesized with the same frequency (p4).  You could extend this to
	include multiple sine-waves.  This way you could synthesize any reasonable
	frequency (within the low and high frequencies of the indicated ATS file),
	and maintain the shape (in frequency) of the indicated atsfile (given by the
	atsbufread).
</p>

3.
<pre>  ktime <strong>line</strong> 0, p3, 2.4
  <strong>atsbufread</strong>  ktime, 1, "crt.ats", 20
  kfreq1, kamp1 <strong>atspartialtap</strong> 1
  kfreq2, kamp2 <strong>atspartialtap</strong> 10
  kfreq3, kamp3 <strong>atspartialtap</strong> 20</pre>
<p>
	This example here uses an atspartialtap, and an atsbufread to read partials
	1, 10 and 20 from crt.ats.  These amplitudes and frequencies could be used to
	re-synthesize those partials, or something all together different.
