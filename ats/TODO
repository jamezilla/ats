Synthesis:

1-Add DC Blocker to the residual
2-Substractive Synthesis
3-Rethink Time envelope (possibly have a time transformation function)
4-Amplitude of residual bands with curves. (we will do it "on the fly" in the Synthesis, can't do it now because I do no have sound output to test the results)


Editing:

2-Track deleting
3-Region deleting
4-Add dismiss button to list view.
5-SMR/Amplitude display.
6-Smart selection using frequency with harmonic factor and SMR threshold.

Analysis: make info printed to stdout into a form with progress bar

- label the zoom bars and contrast bar or separate the two zoom bars out of the contrast one. Take out the number on the latter.


View menu
 Replace Sinusoidal and Noise by a call to a Configuration View Window

- add Help/Documentation menu item that launches the html documentation



all menus: rethink keyboard commands.  several commands do not need a keyboard shortcut, and others need a better letter.
