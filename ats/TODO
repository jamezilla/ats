Synthesis:

1-Add DC Blocker to the residual
2-Substractive Synthesis
3-Rethink Time envelope (possibly have a time transformation function)
4-Amplitude of residual bands with curves. (we will do it "on the fly" in the Synthesis, can't do it now because I do no have sound output to test the results)


Editing:

2-Track deleting
3-Region deleting
4-Add dismiss button to list view.
5-SMR/Amplitude display.
6-Smart selection using frequency with harmonic factor and SMR threshold.

Analysis: make info printed to stdout into a form with progress bar

- label the zoom bars and contrast bar or separate the two zoom bars out of the contrast one. Take out the number on the latter.
- move the frame and frequency info from bottom right corner to bottom centered, or maybe to status bar (if one exists)

View menu
 Replace Sinusoidal and Noise by a call to a Configuration View Window

- add Help/Documentation menu item that launches the html documentation
